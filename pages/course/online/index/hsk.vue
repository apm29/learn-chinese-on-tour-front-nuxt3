      <h1>HSK Test Preparation Courses</h1>
      <p>
        Chinese proficiency test (HSK) is an international standardized test, which
        focuses on the ability of non first language candidates to use Chinese for
        communication in their life, study and work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chinese proficiency test (HSK) includes six levels:
        <NuxtLink to="/hsk/hsk1" class="link"> HSK (level 1) </NuxtLink>,
        <NuxtLink to="/hsk/hsk2" class="link"> HSK (level 2) </NuxtLink>,
        <NuxtLink to="/hsk/hsk3" class="link"> HSK (level 3) </NuxtLink>,
        <NuxtLink to="/hsk/hsk4" class="link"> HSK (level 4) </NuxtLink>,
        <NuxtLink to="/hsk/hsk5" class="link"> HSK (level 5) </NuxtLink> and
        <NuxtLink to="/hsk/hsk6" class="link"> HSK (level 6) </NuxtLink>, with HSK
        (level 6) as the highest level.Candidates who pass HSK (level 6ï¼‰can easily
        understand the Chinese information they hear or read, and express their
        opinions fluently while speaking or writing.
